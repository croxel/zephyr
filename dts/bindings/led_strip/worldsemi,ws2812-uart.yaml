  Worldsemi WS2812 LED strip, UART binding

  Driver bindings for controlling a WS2812 or compatible LED
  strip with a Uart.

  The Uart driver should be usable as long as a zephyr Uart API driver
  is available for your board. Hardware specific tuning is required
  using these properties:

    - uart-baudrate

  Use of this driver implies an 8x internal memory overhead (1 byte of
  driver RAM overhead per bit of pixel data).

compatible: "worldsemi,ws2812-uart"

include: [uart-controller.yaml, ws2812.yaml]
